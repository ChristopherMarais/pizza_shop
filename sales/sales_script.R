# Kim's additions:
# Monthly sales per pizza type
# This code creates a new dataframe (summary table), sales_summary, with three
# columns: pizza, month, and total sales by pizza and month. The group_by() 
# function grouped the sales_data by pizza and month, and the summarize() 
# function summed summed the number of pizzas sold for each pizza x month 
# combination.

# Jinyi's additions:
# Group the sales_data by pizza type and then month. Then calculate the total
# sales for each group, which is the sum of the number value.
# Monthly sales per pizza type

# This code creates a new dataframe (summary table), sales_summary_daily, with 
# three columns: pizza, date, and total sales by pizza and date. The group_by()
# function grouped the sales_data by pizza and date (created in the step above),
# and the summarize() function summed the number of pizzas sold for each 
# pizza x date combination.

# Kim's additions:
# Average data
# This code creates a new dataframe (summary table), sales_ave_daily, with three
# columns: pizza, date, and mean number of sales by pizza and date. The group_by() 
# function grouped the sales_data by pizza and date, and the summarize() 
# function averages number of sales for each pizza x date combination. The
